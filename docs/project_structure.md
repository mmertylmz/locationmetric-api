## Main Directories

### 1. app Directory
This is the main application package containing all your application code.

### 2. tests Directory
Contains all test files for your application.

## App Structure Components

### 1. main.py
- The entry point of your application
- Initializes the FastAPI application
- Registers routers and middlewares
- Contains the root endpoint (`/`)

### 2. api 
- Contains all API-related code
- routes - Organizes API endpoints
  - endpoints.py - Defines API routes using FastAPI routers

### 3. core
- Contains core functionality and configuration
- config.py - Manages application configuration using environment variables

### 4. db
- Database-related code
- database.py - Database connection setup and session management
- models.py - SQLAlchemy ORM models (database tables)

### 5. schemas
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- models.py - Data models for validating API requests and formatting responses

## Architecture Pattern

Your project follows a clean architecture pattern with separation of concerns:

1. **Presentation Layer** (routes)
   - Handles HTTP requests/responses
   - Uses routers to define endpoints

2. **Domain Layer** (schemas)
   - Defines data models and business logic validation

3. **Data Layer** (db)
   - Manages database connections and data models

4. **Configuration** (core)
   - Manages application settings

## Best Practices

To keep your code organized as you develop:

1. **Router Separation**: Continue creating separate router files in routes for different resource types

2. **Service Layer**: Consider adding an `app/services/` directory for complex business logic

3. **Dependencies**: Keep dependency injection in FastAPI's dependency system

4. **Repository Pattern**: For complex database operations, consider adding an `app/repositories/` directory

5. **Utilities**: For helper functions, consider adding an `app/utils/` directory

The current structure follows the FastAPI best practices and will scale well as your application grows. It maintains a clean separation between API endpoints, data validation, and database operations.
